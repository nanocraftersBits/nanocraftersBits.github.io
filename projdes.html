            <h2>Project Design</h2>
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <p>
                For our versatile biosensor, we came up with the following basic design:
                <ul>
                    <li>
There will be a hollow and porous nanocontainer, entrapping signalling molecules. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
The pores of the nanocontainer would be locked and could be opened using only specific keys.
                    </li>
                    <li>
After the pores are unlocked, the signalling molecules would diffuse out and thus the presence of the specific keys could be detected.
                    </li>
                    <li>
We can swap the locks to create multiple variants of the system, each detecting the presence of a different key.
                    </li>
                    <li>
Hence, we can develop a multitude of nanosensors on the go using the same universal design.
                    </li>
                </ul>

With this idea in mind, we scanned through a multitude of chemicals and nanostructures to zero down upon suitable nominees for nanocontainers, signalling molecules and lock.<br>
<h5>
The Nanocontainer : Hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticle:
                </h5>

We thought the following to be the most important requirements to be fulfilled by the nanocontainer:

                <ul>
<li>
                    Structural and thermal stability
                    </li>
                    <li>
Chemically inert
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    
Non toxic
                    </li>
<li>
                    Porous, for easy flow of molecules
                    </li>
                </ul>

We selected hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles (H-MSNs) as nanocontainers. H-MSNs not only satisfy the above mentioned parameters well but are also easy to synthesize.
<br>
H-MSNs have stable mesoporous structure, are biocompatibile, large surface area, and ability to be easily functionalized. The surface of H-MSNs is covered with silanol groups to which both organic and inorganic molecules can be attached conveniently. Moreover, shell volume and thickness can be chemically controlled for the H-MSNs. The shell thickness can control the following properties
                <ul>                
<li>
                    Sensitivity of sensor (diffusion rate depends on shell thickness)
                    </li>
                    <li>
Rigidity and strength (ease of handling)
                    </li>
                </ul>

Small internal volume of H-MSN generates a high concentration gradient with low particle requirement and nearly all particles leave the shell at equilibrium. Therefore they require lower payload to carry. The inner pore wall of the H-MSNs can be selectively modified with functional groups to allow binding of the locks only inside the pores and not on the outer surface.

                <h5>The Locks: Aptamer Gates</h5>

We concluded the following to be the most important requirements to be fulfilled by the locks:
<ul>
<li>
    High sensitivity
    </li>
    <li>
High specificity
    </li>
    <li>
Chemical stability
    </li>
    <li>
Easily interfaceable with the hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles
    </li>
                </ul>

We finalised on aptamers as they fit the above mandate very well.


                <b>Aptamers</b> are identified by an iterative process called SELEX (Selective Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment). The process along with selecting the specific aptamers for such a wide range of molecules also helps in fine tuning their affinity for the targets.<br>

With the help of aptamers, our team has designed gates which could be easily interfaced with H-MSN pores.

                <p class="col s12">
                    Fig: 
                </p>
    <br>
On coming in contact with the target molecules(the keys), the aptamer mesh opens up to release to signalling molecules outside.

    <h5>
The signalling molecules: DNA Origami Structures
    </h5>

We concluded the following to be indispensable properties for effective signalling molecules:
    <ul>

        <li>
 Easily detectable
        </li>
        <li>
 Large enough to not pass through the DNA mesh
        </li>
<li>
        Small enough to pass through the opened pores.
        </li>
 <li>
        Low background noise
        </li>
    </ul>


To fulfill the requirements, our team designed the following DNA origami structures:
                <img class="col s6" src="/img/origami_green.png"/><img class="col s6" src="/img/origami_red.png"/>
<br>
The two different structures have a different fluorescing dye which when close, through the phenomenon of FRET, will give distinct and detectable fluorescence. when the two structures will be close, red fluorescence will be seen and when the two are further apart, yellow fluorescence will be seen. Both the structures contain complementary guide strands, which will help the two types of origamis to form pairs hence bringing the two dyes close enough for FRET to take place (100-101 Å)


<h5>
    Construction
    </h5>

Our team will construct two sets of gated nanoparticles, one containing acceptor dye tagged origami and other containing donor dye tagged origami. The gates, however will be same on both.

    <h5>
Working
    </h5>

Both types of nanoparticles would be added to the test sample in equal amounts. If the sample contains target of the biosensor, it would interact with aptamer gates. On coming in contact with the target molecule, the aptamer mesh of both types of nanoparticles would open up and release the two types of DNA origamis into the solution. Once in the solution, the two types of origamis would come close forming acceptor-donor pairs with the help of guide strands. This would lead to red fluorescence upon excitation.
<br>
    On the other hand, had the target not been present in the sample, the gates would not have opened and the origamis would have remained in their respective nanoparticles and hence would not be able to form donor-acceptor pairs. In this case, we would have seen yellow fluorescence due to relatively larger distance between the two types of origamis.

<h5> 
    Experimental workflow
    </h5>

Our design for the universal biosensor consists of a hollow nanoparticle core with aptamer gated pores. The hollow MSN contains nucleotides of varying lengths, customised for the specific molecule to be sensed.
            The design of Hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles (HMSN) involves making a solid silica core (dSiO2 nanopartcles) and surrounding it with a mesoporous silica layer. <br>
This HMSN synthesis is performed by hard templating. dSiO2 nanoparticles have been used as template. These particles are synthesized according to the Stober's process. Water and ethanol is co-solvent for TetraEthylOrthoSilicate (TEOS) and ammonia is the base catalyst for the synthesis reaction. <br>
TEOS, Cetrimonium Bromide (CTAB) and TriEthanolAmine (TEA) are used for preparation of mesoporous silica layer over these solid silica nanoparticle (dSiO2). TEOS is the silica source, CTAB (a cationic surfactant) is the structure directing agent , and TEA is co-structure directing agent. This procedure will lead to the formation of dSiO2(@CTAB/MSN). <br>
We need to etch out the solid silica core template from dSiO2(@CTAB/MSN) to make hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles (HMSNs). The silica core dissolves in alkaline conditions (pH 10.7). Na2CO3 is used to maintain the pH. The anionic silicates dissolve out of the solid core and are adsorbed at the CTA+ surface present on the mesoporous silica layer. The electrostatic interaction between CTA+ and silicate removes the latter from the solution as they continue to dissolve out and drives the reaction forward. <br>
The HMSNs have the pores are blocked by CTAB. Calcination is used to unblock the pores. Before unblocking the pores, the surface is coated with GOPS. The HMSNs are incubated with signalling molecules. For the signalling molecules, we have designed small DNA origami based rods. These consist of 4 DNA helices and a fluorophore is attached at one extreme end. We make 2 variants; one with a Cy3 dye and the other with a Cy5 dye. Both of them also have specific guide strands, which are complementary to each other. These are filled into different HMSNs, so that now there are effectively 2 types of HMSNs, one containing Cy3 tagged DNA origami and the other containing Cy5 tagged DNA origami. These structures diffuse inside the HMSNs and then the gating modules are attached to the pores to block them. <br>
Gating module is made using two small single stranded DNA sequences of 15-20 base pairs each (Linker DNA) and an aptamer. The linker DNA are pre-functionalized with (3-Glycidyloxypropyl)trimethoxysilane (GOPS). The aptamer will be specific to the target to be sensed by our biosensor. <br>
The HMSNs are incubated with the gating modules. The gating modules bind with the inner surface of the HMSN pores. We predict that multiple gates would go and covalently bind to a single pore, hence forming a mesh like structure. Since the DNA origami is a large structure, it would not be able to pass through the mesh and hence would get trapped inside. The modules don't stray away and bind with the nanoparticle surface because it is already blocked by GOPS in previous steps. The attachment of GOPS to the pore surface happens by silane (GOPS) - silanol (HMSN) reaction. <br>
<em>Voila!</em> The nanoparticles are ready.<br>
Now, for <b>biosensing</b>, a mixture of both types of nanoparticles – one containing Cy3 dye and the other containing Cy5 dye can be added to the sample to be analysed. If suppose the target molecules are absent, the gates do not open up and the origami remain trapped in their respective particles. Now, upon excitation only the green dye fluoresces and we see a green colour since the nanoparticles are transparent.<br>
But, if suppose the target molecules were present, the gates would open up as a result of the target molecules binding to the aptamers and loosening up the mesh. The origami would come out of the nanoparticles and each Cy3 tagged origami will pair with a Cy5 tagged origami due to presence of the complementary guide strands. Now, when we would excite the green dye, we would actually see a yellow colour due to a phenomenon called FRET or Fluorescence Resonant Energy Transfer. In this, an excited green dye actually transfers a part of its energy to the red dye due to which it also fluoresces along with the green dye. This gives it a yellow colour.<br>
Now coming to the high throughput part. This process can be scaled up to sense multiple molecules at once. Multiple variants of the nanoparticle mixture can be prepared, each having a different type of aptamer in the gate (and hence a different target). Each variant can be immobilized in a single well of a 96-well plate. Sample to be tested can be added to each of the wells. Upon excitation, the degree of yellowness can be measured to quantitatively predict the presence or absence of respective molecules.
