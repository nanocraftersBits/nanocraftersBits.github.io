                <h5>Motivation</h5>

During our literature survey, we found that numerous designs have been proposed for biosensors. Each design works pretty well for the target it was designed for, initially. However, many times, its adaptability for use with other molecules remains a question. We feel that this is a major drawback for a technology having such great potential. There should exist a universal design for biosensors in general which can be easily adapted to use with a large variety of molecules. This would not only reduce the amount of time and resources required for development of these sensors but would also lead to their increased presence in our daily lives.<br>
Our team has taken up challenge to create such a universal design using hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles and DNA origami based nanostructures.

                <h5>DNA Origami</h5>
                DNA origami is nanoscale folding of DNA strands to desirable shapes. These structures are stable in being less susceptible to enzyme attacks than bare nucleic acid strands. They are a hot topic for current research as they have various applications like drug delivery, nanoelectronic circuitry, enzyme immobilisation, DNA nanorobots etc.[1] The design of the desired shape is made by raster filling the shape with kilobases long DNA strand, held in place with the help of short oligonucleotide ‘staple strands’. The strands self-assemble to nanometer scale structures once, mixed together.[2] Finally, these individual structures can be made into large assemblies useful for targeted drug delivery, enzyme immobilisation etc. <br>
The technique of DNA origami started with the work of Paul Rothemund when he used 7kB scaffold strands and 200 base long staple strands to create “smiling face” structures. [2]<br>
CADNano is a CAD based program that gives a platform for designing DNA origami structures. The staples are to be designed according to the structure and complementary to the scaffold strand within the program.

                <h5>Forster Resonance Energy Transfer(FRET)</h5>
                FRET is a distance dependent resonance energy transfer between two dye molecules without the emission of photons. A fluorescent donor is excited at its specific fluorescence excitation wavelength. By long range dipole-dipole coupling mechanism, this excitation energy is then non-radiatively transferred to a second molecule, the acceptor, while the donor returns to the ground state. 
<br>
The conditions that need to be met for FRET to occur[3]:
                <ul>
                    <li>
The donor and the acceptor must be 10-100 Å apart.
                    </li>
                    <li>
The donor and acceptor dipoles must be approximately parallel.
                    </li>
                    <li>
The absorption spectrum of the acceptor must overlap with the emission spectrum of the donor.
                    </li>
                </ul>
We use fluorescein (green) as the donor and rhodamine (red) as the acceptor. When the two dyes are at a distance less than the Forster distance the emission of the donor dyes excites the red dye. As a result only red fluorescence is seen. However, when the dyes are farther apart, the efficiency of energy transfer from the green dye to red dye decreases hence leading to a yellow colour (due to both the dyes simultaneously fluorescing).


                <h5>FTIR</h5>
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), uses infrared spectroscopy and then runs the data through a fourier transform to get the final results.<br>
Infrared spectroscopy involves excitation of sample using infrared region of the light spectra. A graph of percent transmitted versus wavenumber is obtained for analysis.
The data gives a detailed insight of the different types of bonds present in our sample. On comparing with a standard table/ graph we can estimate accurately the presence/ absence of particular bonds, thus allowing us to characterise the chemical nature of our sample.
In FTIR, different combinations of light frequencies are irradiated onto the sample at different time points. This gives different sets of transmittance/absorbance data points for each combination of frequencies. All these data points are consolidated using Fourier transform,which produces a final data set of different absorbance/ transmittance percentages at different wavelengths.

            <h4>
            Applications
            </h4>
            <h5>
Versatile Biosensors
            </h5>
The nanoparticle based biosensors designed by our team can be adapted to perform a wide range of sensing functions. In theory, anything for which an aptamer can be made, can be sensed using a variant of our biosensor.

            <h5>
Compound Biosensors
            </h5>
Not only can our biosensor sense a large variety of molecules one at a time, it can be used to create something we call “Compound Biosensors”. In this, donor tagged origami containing particles are gated with an aptamer sensitive to “Signal A” while the acceptor tagged origami containing ones are gated with an aptamer sensitive to “Signal B”. In such a case, a mixture of these 2 types of particles would give a red colour only in presence of both the signals, A and B. This is useful in complex sensing applications where the output to be tested is a result of interaction between multiple input signals.

            <h5>High throughput Biosensing</h5>
The method of biosensing employed by these biosensors can be easily scaled up to accomplish high throughput biosensing. Multiple variants of the nanoparticle mixture, each having a different type of gate (different aptamer) can be immobilized in different wells of an ELISA plate. Now, each well would act as a biosensor for a particular target. The sample to be analysed can be added to each of the wells and fluorescence can be measured. Such an approach to biosensing can be very helpful in a multitude of scenarios. For example, a given water sample can be tested for a multitude of contaminants at once, hence giving a complete “water profile”. It can also be used in cancer diagnostics to detect multiple types of cancers.
